## ðŸ—¼ Architecture & Data Flow

[![MVVM](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/9q6VpRVAVdLL.png?o=1 "MVVM")](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/9q6VpRVAVdLL.png?o=1 "MVVM")

- [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelâ€“viewâ€“viewmodel) (MVVM) pattern helps to completely separate the business and presentation logic from the UI
- [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) For small projects, MVVM is sufficient, but as our codebase grows more extensive, the ViewModels begin to bloat. It becomes challenging to separate responsibilities. For that case, MVVM with Clean Architecture is a suitable choice.

- [Modularization](https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization) enables separate functionality into independent, interchangeable modules. But in this project I only make separate module for core, data and domain module, while the feature module is not due to the small project size/feature

- Based on Clean Architecture's rules, the app consist of 3 layer :
  1. Data Layer
     The one who responsible as the source of data, and has a direct contact with API or local DB.
     This layer contains Repository Implementation to returns data from a Data Source (Cached or Remote), and has a Mapper class to map object model from data layer to domain layer, and usually a service to interact with API (in this app there is no API connection).

  2. Domain Layer
     From "flow of data" perspective, this layer connects the presentation layer and data layer. It contains entities, usecase and repository interfaces.

  3. Presentation Layer
     It observes data using LiveData inside viewModel, and if there an update or new value assigned to livedata, the presentation (Fragment/Activity) will be updated.

##  Data Source

I used dummy data in MachineRepositoryImpl as the first source of data, and then the data will be saved to local database using Room. And every update of the machine data (update name, type, images) will be queried by using Room.
